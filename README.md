- ### Format-

```
{
  "data": [],
  "message": "message",

}
```

- ### For Example :-

    "created_at": "2022-01-23T23:25:37.435+00:00",
    "updated_at": "2022-01-25T12:59:35.004+00:00",
    "team_id": 2
  },
  "message": "successfully retrived!",
  "status": 200
}
```

> ## Note :-

Since in this project we are dealing with _date_ and _time_,it would be cumbersome for us to write **json** raw request body while testing Endpoints like <mark style=background:#f5c85f!important> **home/createPlayer** </mark> , <mark style=background:#f55f5f!important> **home/createTeam** </mark> , <mark style=background:#7fc756!important> **home/updateTeam/{id}** </mark> ,or <mark style=background:#5c97d1!important> **home/updatePlayer/{id}** </mark>. To solve this problem,I have used <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important> **@PrePersist** </mark> and <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important> **@PreUpdate** </mark> annotations to add lifecycle events in order to add date and time automatically, which implies that there is no need to specify parameters like <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important> **created_at**</mark> and <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important> **updated_at**</mark> in the raw json request body.

- Also,since <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important>"id"</mark> is **primary key** in both the models, therefore we dont have to specify id parameter during _'create'_ operations because using <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important> @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)</mark> annotation
  unique **id**'s will be generated and stored automatically !:smile:

* Use these example raw json request bodies for _create_ operation:

For **Teams** Model -

```json
{
  "location": "Enter string value",
  "name": "Enter string value"
}
```

For **Players** Model -

```
{
  "age": Enter integer value ,
  "name": "Enter string value",
  "team_id": Enter integer value
}
```

:point_right: **No need to specify other parameters,this will work perfectly**.:smile:

- For Update operations just follow following steps. :point_down:

  1. For Example,If you want to update player with player **Id** = 5 use <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important>home/findAPlayer/5</mark>.and copy the result.

```
{
  "id": 5,
  "name": "shubham yadav",
  "age": 24,
  "created_at": "2022-01-23T23:24:03.726+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2022-01-24T13:40:03.189+00:00",
  "team_id": 2
}
```

2. Now use <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important>home/updatePlayer/5</mark> and paste the copied result (from **Step 1**) in the raw json request body text area in **POSTMAN**.Remove the auto generated Fields like(**id**,**created_at**,**updated_at**).

```
{
  "name": "shubham yadav",
  "age": 24,
  "team_id": 2
}
```

3. Change the value of only those parameters which you want to update.Now click on **Send** button!

```
{
  "name": "shubham singh",
  "age": 24,
  "team_id": 3
}
```

:tada: Player is Succesfully updated! You can confirm it by using <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important>home/findAPlayer/5</mark>.

Result :

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "message": "successfully updated!",
  "status": 200
}
```

> ## Testing :-

**Read the above note before testing**

### 1. Testing-<mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important>**home/createTeam**</mark> Endpoint :-

- This will create a new Team.

- Select **POST** method on **POSTMAN**.

* Pass the raw json request body in the text area

Example json request body-

```json
{
  "location": "Punjab_Sikandars",
  "name": "Amritsar"
}
```

:white_check_mark:**id , created_at and updated_at fields will be automatically generated.**

```url
localhost:8080/home/deleteTeam/4
```

:red_circle: 8080 is the port on which the Tomcat server was started in my system.You can check your port number,and write url accordingly.:+1:

:red_circle:Since we have one to many unidirectional relationship between **team** model and **player** model,so in order to remove a team,You have to remove all the players playing for that
perticular team to maintain **referential integrity**.

:white_check_mark:To solve this problem just use <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important>home/deletePlayersByTeamId/{team_id}</mark>:smile::+1:

:white_check_mark:Confirm the result using <mark style=background:#a4a7ab!important>home/findATeam/{id}</mark>
